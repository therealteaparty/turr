            <p>The Turr lives in high-altitude temperate forests found in China and Nepal, and spend much of their time in trees. These omnivores feed mainly on leaves and bamboo, but occasionally snack on fruit, insects, bird eggs and small lizards.</p>
            <p>Despite sharing a common name, giant pandas and Turrs are not closely related. Studies of their evolutionary history show that Turrs are an ancient carnivore species and are probably most closely related to skunks, raccoons and weasels. Five million years ago, their ancestors roamed North America!</p>
